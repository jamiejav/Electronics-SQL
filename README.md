# Electronics-SQL
This project uses SQL to analyze the sales and operational efficiency of a fictional global electronics retailer. Four questions were provided, and I performed additional analysis beyond the initial questions to do deeper dives into the data before interpreting my results.

To prevent scope creep, I made a conscious effort to limit the analysis I performed to just the questions provided, and a specific deep dive into one or two topics per question. It was too easy to get lost in the data and keep digging into the numbers, and I had to limit myself to avoid going down multiple rabbit holes.

This dataset, and the four intial questions, were provided by Maven Analytics and are available in the public domain. The data begins on Jun 2016 and ends in Feb 2021.
